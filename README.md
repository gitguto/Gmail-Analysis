# Gmail-Analysis

A place to store some gmail analysis. 

The first goal of this project is to find who are the n most frequent senders addresses in a gmail acccount. (they are usually annoying spams, and it is useful to know who they are in order to delete multiple annoying emails at once).

The second goal is to do some exploratory analysis in a gmail account. 

Lastly, I will try to tide up my gmail account from a Python IDE. (that is, deleting some undesired emails).
